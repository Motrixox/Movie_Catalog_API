# Movie Catalog API

Pitney Bowes internship task.

1. Tech stack: dotnet core
2. Domain:

   - Movie Catalog REST API, that contains the following methods:
     - POST: allows to add a movie to the catalog,
     - GET: allows retrieving the last added movie,
     - GET/[year]: retrieves movies from a given year,
     - GET/[genre]: retrieves movies from a given genre. 

   - Data can be stored in memory or text file (no DB is required – unless you want to, then use any DB that you can stash in docker).

3. Additional requirements: 

   - Logging HTTP requests to the console. 
   - “Write your code as well as you can.”
   - Code must compile without warnings (tip: we’ll use the ‘dotnet build’ command)
   - Code must run (tip: well use ‘dotnet run’ command)

4. Optional: write with unit tests if you can.
